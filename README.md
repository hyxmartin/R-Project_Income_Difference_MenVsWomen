# RProject---Income_Difference_MenVsWomen

My task for this project is to write a report addressing the following problem:

Is there a significant difference in income between men and women? Does the difference vary depending on other factors (e.g., education, marital status, criminal history, drug use, childhood household factors, profession, etc.)?

A natural outcome variable for the data is TOTAL INCOME FROM WAGES AND SALARY IN PAST CALENDAR YEAR (TRUNC) (2012 survey question). Note that this quantity is topcoded, meaning that you do not get to see the actual incomes for the top 2% of earners. For the top 2% of earners, the income variable is set to the average income among the 2% of earners. 

RMD is a markup file that will knit to html.
The raw data is store in my personal cloud, also is available in the project folder for reference.

The nlsy79_var_descriptions includes the survey description.
The nlsy79_var_info.txt includes field info.

html is the final result, however, if anyone would like to see R code, please run .rmd directly.

Thank you, please shot me email if you have any question.
