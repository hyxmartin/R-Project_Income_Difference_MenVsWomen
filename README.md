# RProject---Income_Difference_MenVsWomen
RMD is a markup file that will knit to html.
The raw data is store in my personal cloud, also is available in the project folder for reference.

The nlsy79_var_descriptions includes the survey description.
The nlsy79_var_info.txt includes field info.

html is the final result, however, if anyone would like to see R code, please run .rmd directly.

Thank you, please shot me email if you have any question.
